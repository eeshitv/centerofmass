ROK Foci for each cell using the EDGE data

First I find the center of mass for each cell. Then I find the radial profiles(32 radial profiles) for each of the cells. 

Next I plot the intensities and make conclusions to characterize the system. The ultimate goal is to characterize the orientation
of proteins in a cell

************************************

1)I will do all of this for MBS now and then compare ROK and MYOSIN with MBS
2)I will get histograms for frequency of distances to get an idea of the distribution of these maximal distances.
3)To develop an intuition of how cross correlation works; I will get correlation as a function of offset and see if we get a maxima at the offset correponding to the mean distance between maximas of the fibers.
